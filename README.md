### How it works

This resume is stored as JSON following the [JSON Resume schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/v1.0.0/schema.json). When changes are committed, GitHub Actions copies the JSON file to a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/nwithan8/65f296251b18fca7f443268578a8529f), which is then picked up by the [JSON Resume Registry](https://jsonresume.org/getting-started/).
